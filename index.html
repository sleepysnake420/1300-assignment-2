                CSCI 1300 : Responsive Redesign
            </h1>

            <h2>
                Overview
            </h2>

            <p class="main-content">
                The goal of this assignment is to practice the 
                workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
                Here I analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, 
                create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for 
                various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based 
                on those prototypes.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Identifying Usability Problems
            </h2>

            <p class="main-content">
                The website I have chosen to redesign is The Wild Colonial Tavern.<br>
                <a href="http://www.wildcolonial.com/" style="color: #F6FBFD;" target="_blank">Click here to see the website</a>
                <br><br>
                Since the Wild Colonial Tavern is one of my favorite bars in 
                Providence but also has a highly unresponsive and badly 
                designed website, I chose that page as my example. 
                The image is simply chopped/overflows on resize, and is arbitrarily 
                positioned at the 
                center because it does not adapt to the size of the screen. 
                You may easily overlook the various menu items because they are 
                so tiny and have such a weak contrast to the backdrop color. 
                There is a lot of room for redesigning this page.
            </p>

                Problems

            <div>
                <ul class="problems_list">
                    <li>Homepage badly designed with a huge image at the center but very small and low contrast menu items that a user could miss</li>
                    <li>Image does not scale with screen size and instead overflows</li>
                    <li>Bad or insufficient use of margins, padding</li>
                    <li>Bad naming and usage of menu items (One of them just says I-phone and it located before the Home menu item)</li>
                    <li>Huge gap above the photo and below the contact information for no reason</li>
                    <li>No icon next to tab title</li>
                    <li>Website is insecure (http not https)</li>
                    <li>Lighthouse analysis fails indicating that certain key features or elements are missing from the website code</li>
                    <li>Learnability and memorability is low as the menu items are not standard and are verbose</li>
                    <li>Footer could be implemented to house contact information</li>
                    <li>Navbar could be implemented to better display the menu items</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="problems_list">
                    <li>Language missing or Invalid</li>
                    <li>No heading structure</li>
                    <li>No page regions / ARIA markers</li>

                The three problems mentioned above were found by the WAVE evaluation 
                tool. I concur with their conclusions. Due to "lingo" or informal 
                terminology used in menu items, some people, especially those who 
                come from outside of this region, may not comprehend it. 
                The absence of headings on the website compromises its usability 
                and readability. Additionally, the absence of region or ARIA 
                indicators makes it impossible for screen readers to understand 
                what is happening on the website, excluding users with visual 
                impairments.
                Additionally, although though WAVE did not notice the contrast 
                problems, I think they are present on the website and need to be 
                manually checked.

                Low-Fidelity Prototypes

            <p class="main-content">
                The low-fidelity prototypes were created using Balsamiq. 
                I created three different prototypes for three different screen 
                sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

                The visual design style guide was created on Figma. 
                It helped in visualizing the design of the website and decide on
